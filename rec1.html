Step-1 
Take 3/4 cup short grained rice in a bowl and wash it for 3-4 times using water. 
Step-2
Soak it in 1 1/2-cups water for at least 3-4 hours
Step-3
Drain the excess water and transfer it to the jar of a mixer grinder or blender. Add grated coconut in it.
Step-4 
Grind until smooth batter. Add water as required to grind the rice smoothly. 
Don't add too much water while grinding, as it would make it difficult ti grind the smooth batter.
Step-5
Transfer it to a large bowl. Add salt and mix well.
Step-6
Add water little by little and mix well until the batter turns into thin and watery consistency(like milk consistency).
Step-7
Batter should not be thick. It should have the consistency like buttermilk or milk.
Step-8
Heat a non stick dosa tawa/skillet over medium flame. Make sure that tawa is hot. Sprinkle few drop of water on the surface and wait until it evaporates.
Wipe the surface of tawa with cloth or halved potato. Do this process before making each dosa that helps in making thin dosas.
Step-9
Take ladle full batter and pour it on the surface in circular motion starting from edge towards the center from approx. 3-4 inches height like rava dosa. 
Pour the batter until it covers center of the surface. Immediately tilt the tawa evenly into thin circle. As you pour the batter, few holes will be formed on the surface, 
it means the batter has right consistency.If it doesn't happen it means batter is thick.
Step-10
Drizzle 1/2-teaspoon oil around edges of it. Cook covered until upper surface looks cooked, it will take around 2-3 minutes. Make sure that the bottom surfavce should not turn brown in color.
Step-11
Remove the lid.
Step-12
Fold it on either side with a spatula
Step-13
Again fold it into triangular shape. Transfer it to a plate. Make thin and soft dosas in the same way using leftover batter. Hot neerdosas are ready to serve.
